SudokuSolver is a plain C platform independent program made to test different Sudoku solving
algorithms.

It is built upon standard C libraries, so it does not have any special dependency.

Code has been tested on a Linux-based system and a simple Linux makefile has been included too.

SudokuSolver is licensed under GPLv3.
