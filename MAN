        Target file must be an ASCII text file that represents the Sudoku table that has to be
        solved and it must follow this syntax:
        
        xxxxxxxxx
        xxxxxxxxx
        xxxxxxxxx
        xxxxxxxxx
        xxxxxxxxx

        xxxxxxxxx
        xxxxxxxxx
        
        where if x is a digit from 1 to 9 it represents a fixed cell (containing that digit), if x
        is any other ASCII character (except for special ones) it represents an empty cell.
